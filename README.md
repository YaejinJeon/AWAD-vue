## Functions I need (Nikitos)

- I want the bot to save new words
- Persistant store
- Web interface for easier database managment
- Conference mode (bot in a conference). Collaborative usage
- Private chat mode (tet-a-ter messaging).
- All the events generated by a user are saved in the database for further usage and analysis
- Hashtags as categories
- Bot must support messages edits. (If I edit a word card. It should update its database record)
- Simple new words cards syntax. 

## Other possible features (Nikitos)

- Export to Notion.so table
- https://context.reverso.net/ support

Grammar is 
```
word
#tag1 #tag2
#tag3

/transcription/

= meaning 1
- example sentance 1

= meaning 2
- example for the meaning 2 sentance 1
- example for the meaning 2 sentance 2
```

Example:

```
diligence
#noun #gaming

/ˈdɪlɪdʒ(ə)ns/

= careful and persistent work or effort.

- The new guy is very creative but I think he needs to develop the virtue of diligence
- few party members challenge his diligence as an MP
```

transcription is optional. order of data is arbitrary

So the Word interface
```
interface Word {
    word: str
    transcription: Option[str]
    tags: List[str]
    meanings: List[Meaning]
}
```
